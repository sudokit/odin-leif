# A binding/wrapper library for an awesome GUI library [LEIF](https://github.com/cococry/leif/)
still a bit rough since the library used a lot of macros and they were annoying :p. pull requests are welcome!

## TODOs:
- [ ] add examples
- [ ] do something about the #file and #line args. look a bit ugly (used for IDs internally in the c library.

## usage
go to [LEIF](https://github.com/cococry/leif/) and follow the installation instructions. after that just import this in your Odin project and you should be good to go. (there is one flag you need to add to Odin command, will update later once i remember.

## example
(need to add later, for now you can just do a basic OpenGL setup in odin and then copy the example from Leif repo and translate it. ```lf_``` just becomes ```lf.``` (assuming you imported it as lf)
