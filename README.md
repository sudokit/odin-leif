# A binding/wrapper library for an awesome GUI library [LEIF](https://github.com/cococry/leif/)
still highly wip. pull requests are welcome! (not much works yet. need help with the struct stuff and the #define fucntions)

- thinking of just making a wrapper for this
TODO:
- [] need to do something ab the default arguments on some functions (#file and #line). Looks ugly. Related to how the library stores components. Uses the #file and #line to create a hash
