# A binding/wrapper library for an awesome GUI library [LEIF](https://github.com/cococry/leif/)
still a bit rough since the library used a lot of macros and they were annoying :p. pull requests are welcome!

TODO:
- [ ] add examples
- [ ] do something about the #file and #line args. look a bit ugly (used for IDs internally in the c library.
